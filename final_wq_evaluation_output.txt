Nothing could be further from the truth. Earning more money, in and of itself, rarely frees people. It's equally ridiculous to tell yourself that greater financial freedom and mastery of your finances would not offer your greater opportunities to expand, share, and create value for yourself and others.", "I have not observed men's honesty to increase with their riches.", "No man's fortune can be an end worthy of his being.", "Make all you can, save all you can, give all you can.", "There is no fortune so strong that money cannot take it.", "No man's credit is ever as good as his money.", "When a man says money can do anything, that settles it.

All their cares, hopes, joys, affections, virtues, and associations seemed to be melted down into dollars. Whatever the chance contributions that fell into the slow cauldron of their talk, they made the gruel thick and slab with dollars. Men were weighed by their dollars, measures were gauged by their dollars; life was auctioned, appraised, put up, and knocked down for its dollars. The next respectable thing to dollars was any venture having their attainment for its end. The more of that worthless ballast, honor and fair-dealing, which any man cast overboard from the ship of his Good Nature and Good Intent, the more ample stowage-room he had for dollars. Make commerce one huge lie and mighty theft. Deface the banner of the nation for an idle rag; pollute it star by star; and cut out stripe by stripe as from the arm of a degraded soldier. Do anything for dollars! What is a flag to them!", "Money may be the husk of many things, but not the kernel. It brings you food, but not appetite; medicine, but not health; acquaintances, but not friends; servants, but not faithfulness; days of joy, but not peace and happiness.", "When I chased after money, I never had enough. When I got my life on purpose and focused on giving of myself and everything that arrived into my life, then I was prosperous.", "Our income are like our shoes; if too small, they gall and pinch us; but if too large, they cause us to stumble and trip.", "Money is always there but the pockets change.", "A nickel isn't worth a dime today.", "The Lord commonly gives riches to foolish people, to whom he gives nothing else.", "God shows his contempt for wealth by the kind of person he selects to receive it.", "His money is twice tainted: taint yours and taint mine.", "The lack of money is the root of all evils.", "Nowadays nothing but money counts: a fortune brings honors, friendships, the poor man everywhere lies low.", "Whatever you have spend less.", "Once upon a time only Washington's face was on our money, now Washington's hands are on it too.", "When money is taken freedom is forsaken.", "I know of nothing more despicable and pathetic than a man who devotes all the hours of the waking day to the making of money for money's sake.", "Money is like fire, an element as little troubled by moralizing as earth, air and water. Men can employ it as a tool or they can dance around it as if it were the incarnation of a god. Money votes socialist or monarchist, finds a profit in pornography or translations from the Bible, commissions Rembrandt and underwrites the technology of Auschwitz. It acquires its meaning from the uses to which it is put.", "The love of money grows as the money itself grows.", "If you are poor, though you dwell in the busy marketplace, no one will inquire about you; if you are rich, though you dwell in the heart of the mountains, you will have distant relatives.", "It doesn't matter whether you are rich or poor -- as long as you've got money.", "I don't like money actually, but it quiets the nerves.", "God makes, and apparel shapes; but it's money that finishes the man.", "Money begets money.", "Where gold speaks every tongue is silent.", "Money is a singular thing. It ranks with love as man's greatest source of joy. And with death as his greatest source of anxiety. Over all history it has oppressed nearly all people in one of two ways: either it has been abundant and very unreliable, or reliable and very scarce.", "It is not how much one makes but to what purpose one spends.", "It is a kind of spiritual snobbery that makes people think they can be happy without money.", "Those who are of the opinion that money will do everything may reasonably be expected to do everything for money.", "When money speaks the truth is silent.", "If you want to know what God thinks of money, look at the people he gives it to.", "Money often costs too much.", "There is only one class in the community that thinks more about money than the rich, and that is the poor. The poor can think of nothing else.", "I'm tired of love; I'm still more tired of rhyme; but money gives me pleasure all the time.", "Ready money is Aladdin's lamp.", "Money can't buy health, happiness, or what it did last year.", "The poor man's budget is full of schemes.", "When asked what would he do if he found $1 million, Yogi responded, If the guy was poor, I'd give it back.", "All riches have their origin in mind. Wealth is in ideas -- not money.", "All things are sold: the very light of heaven is venal; earth's unsparing gifts of love, the smallest and most despicable things that lurk in the abysses of the deep, all objects of our life, even life itself, and the poor pittance which the laws allow of liberty, the fellowship of man, those duties which his heart of human love should urge him to perform instinctively, are bought and sold as in a public mart of not disguising selfishness, that sets on each its price, the stamp-mark of her reign.", "Money is not required to buy one necessity of the soul.", "A fool and her money are soon courted.", "Almost any man knows how to earn money, but not one in a million knows how to spend it.", "Getting money is like digging with a needle, spending it is like water soaking into sand.", "The way by which you may get money almost without exception leads downward.", "Money differs from an automobile or mistress in being equally important to those who have it and those who do not.", "Money is like manure. You have to spread it around or it smells.", "The trick is to make sure you don't die waiting for prosperity to come.", "Why is there so much month left at the end of the money?", "When the strong box contains no more both friends and flatterers shun the door.", "Business, you know, may bring you money, but friendship hardly ever does.", "The price we have to pay for money is sometimes liberty.", "Many of the things you can count, don't count. Many of the things you can't count, really count.", "Money doesn't always bring happiness. A man with ten million dollars is no happier than a man with nine million dollars.", "Don't ever let economic alone determine your career or how you spend the majority of your time.", "The universal regard for money is the one hopeful fact in our civilization. Money is the most important thing in the world. It represents health, strength, honor, generosity and beauty. Not the least of its virtues is that it destroys base people as certainly as it fortifies and dignifies noble people.", "If a person gets his attitude toward money straight, it will help straighten out almost every other area in his life.", "Money, it turned out, was exactly like sex, you thought of nothing else if you didn't have it and thought of other things if you did.", "Money is the representative of a certain quantity of corn or other commodity. It is so much warmth, so much bread.", "Lack of money is the root of all evil.", "If you're going to lend money make sure somebody else is around. If you're going to give money make sure nobody else is around.", "There is nothing so habit-forming as money.", "The safest way to double your money is to fold over once and put it in your pocket.", "Money won't make you happy... but everybody wants to find out for themselves."]
